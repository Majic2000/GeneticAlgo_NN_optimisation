# GeneticAlgo_NN_optimisation
NN weight optimisation using genetic algorithms. NSGA-II, Efficient non-dominated sorting, tournament selection, embedded rprop learning, lamarckian learning approach, amongst others. Did this during my course at university, opened me a window to efficient optimisation and greater model development.
